James Thorburn et. al. (2018) Aquatic Conserv: Mar Freshw Ecosyst. 2018;28:1167\'961180 ; Data for n (population) and He includes FS relationship. Data for n and He excluding FS relationship vary by very little from the data I plotted so I chose not to include the data. I also did not include data that were not in HWE. This goes as following: locus DFU285 for the Wales site. If I were to remove the Fs relationships, only SACA 6396 in Celtic Sea and Southern North Sea + SACA 3853 in Southern North Sea would be out of HWE.\

Ingo J. Timm et. al (2012) Conserv Genet 13:693\'96706 ; Had to obtain coordinates using Google maps since only specific site names were mentioned in the paper. For multiple sites, I picked a point between the sites and used them for my coordinates. The sites are (Samalona, Barranglompo, Barrangcaddi) & (Kapoposang, Suranti).\
The rest of the sites required me to pick a point since it varied between multiple island clusters or an entire town. For both cases, I picked coordinates located in the middle of the clusters of islands or town. For the Batam site, instead of locus 45, it is a monomorph causing there to be no data obtained for this specific locus in this location.\

\cf0 Anton P. Van de Putte (2012) Marine Genomics 8 23\'9634; The sites Cape Armitage and Cape Roberts may have been mislabelled in the papers map. Therefore, I used the coordinates I found on google maps for each site rather than using the paper\'92s labelled sites to pick my coordinates. The rest of the sites were labelled correctly when comparing the paper\'92s labelled sites and site locations in google maps. Due to there being data that was not in HWE, I have refrained from inputing the following data in the spreadsheet: For Trematomus newnesi- Site SO (Trne035 and Trne066), Site TA1 (Trne035). Due to possible mislabelling in the table, it is possible that the following are monomorphs due to the data provided and was also excluded: For Trematomus bernacchii-  Site DI (Trne055), Site EI (Trne055), Site JI (Trne055) and Site SO (Trne055). Due to possible mislabelling in the paper\'92s map, site Casey (CS) could vary by 4 degrees longitudinal wise. Therefore, I decided to not include the data for that site entirely. \

(2013) Biodivers Conserv 22:3045\'963065; excluded the following due to it being not in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg proportions: Clupea harengus (Outside Baltic), Pungitius pungitius (Outside Baltic, The Kvark, Bothnian Bay). Excluded the following species as they are not fish species: Mytilus trossulus & Fucus vesiculosus. For Clupea harengus, Esox lucius, & Coregonus lavaretus, the He data comes from the avg of all loci together at the specific location. Avgs of crossSpp and repeats of loci in paper have been recorded. For Gasterosteus aculeatus & Pungitius pungitius, The He data comes from the avg of all loci together at the specific location but I was unable to find crossSpp & repeat patterns.\
\
Wildes et al. (2011) Fish. Bull. 109:382\'96393; excluded the following collections due to it being not the most recent year recorded and/or sample size is smaller: Berners Bay 07 & Berners Bay 08, Sitka Sound 07, Lynn Canal 07 & Lynn Canal 08a.\
\
Xu et al. (2011) Genet. Mol. Res. 10 (3): 1701-1706; excluded this paper as the sampling sites varied by more than 3 degrees of latitude and longitude wise. He was also not shown explicitly. Instead, the data is presented as the decimal answer of Ho/He. \

\cf2 Verissimo et al. (2017) Ecology and Evolution, 7:4768\'964781; excluded this paper. Although the paper mentions He (expected heterozygosity) in table 1, it does not plot the data. Therefore, I was unable to include this paper. \
\
Teacher et al. (2012) Evolutionary Applications 6:549\'96567; included He for the 59 loci since Her14 is seen as an outlier. Also excluded site

\f1  since the paper stated that it appeared to be an outlier as well. 
\f0\fs24 Because the He\'92s are an avg for each specific location, the avg of CrossSpp and repeat pattern was also taken}
