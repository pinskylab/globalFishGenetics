# Latitudinal Gradients in Marine Genetic Diversity
## Data Entry Instructions v.1

## We want to enter data from:
Population genetic studies on marine fish that use microsatellite loci, report genetic diversity, and report where the samples were taken.

## Step 1. Choose which studies to use
The list of potential studies is contained in spreadsheets titled All References 1.xlsx, All References 2.xlsx, All Reference 3.xlsx, and All References 4.xlsx. We need to skim the abstract of each study (the column labeled “AB”) and determine if it might be suitable. The key criteria are:

1. Marine fish? 
a. Is the paper about a marine fish? 
b. If you’re not sure, enter the species name in www.fishbase.org or www.fishbase.us and read about the species. If the species is anadromous (lives at sea but spawns in freshwater), catadromous (live in freshwater but spawns at sea), or amphidromous (regular movement between fresh and salt water, but not to breed), then we don’t count it as marine.
2. Msat?
a. Does the study use microsatellites?
3. Wild?
a. Does the study examine wild populations?
4. Non-EST?
a. Does the study use microsatellites that aren’t linked to Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs)? 
b. We don’t use EST-linked microsatellites, so if the study is only about those, we don’t want it. If the study uses EST-linked microsatellites, it will probably say so in the abstract. If it doesn’t mention anything, the study is probably OK.
c. ESTs are bits of genetic material copied from an organisms’ transcriptome (the mRNA) and so is likely to be closely associated with genes that matter to the organisms’ fitness. These are more likely to be experiencing natural selection.

For each question, enter a Y or an N in the appropriate column. That cell will turn from grey to red or green. If you answer N to any question, you don’t need to fill in the rest of the columns. The “Enter?” column will turn green (good to go!) or red (ignore this paper) depending on your answers.

When it’s time to save your file, title it:

All References A III YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx

where A is the spreadsheet number (1-4), III are your initials, YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and DD is the day.

##Step 2. Collect PDFs
We’ll then collect PDFs of the papers we need and begin the real work.
