# Latitudinal Gradients in Marine mtDNA Genetic Diversity
## Data Entry Instructions v.1

## We want to enter data from:
Population genetic studies on marine fish that use mtDNA sequence, report haplotype sequences, and report where the samples were taken.

## Step 1. Choose which studies to use
The list of potential studies is contained in spreadsheets titled All mtDNA References 1.xlsx, All mtDNA References 2.xlsx, All mtDNA Reference 3.xlsx, and All mtDNA References 4.xlsx. We need to skim the abstract of each study (the column labeled “AB”) and determine if it might be suitable. The key criteria are:

1. Marine fish? 
a. Is the paper about a marine fish? 
b. If you’re not sure, enter the species name in www.fishbase.org or www.fishbase.us and read about the species. If the species is anadromous (lives at sea but spawns in freshwater), catadromous (live in freshwater but spawns at sea), or amphidromous (regular movement between fresh and salt water, but not to breed), then we don’t count it as marine.
2. mtDNA?
a. Does the study use mitochondrial DNA?
3. Wild?
a. Does the study examine wild populations?

For each question, enter a “y” or an “n” in the appropriate column. That cell will turn from grey to red or green. If you answer n to any question, you don’t need to fill in the rest of the columns. The “Enter?” column will turn green (good to go!) or red (ignore this paper) depending on your answers.

When it’s time to save your file, title it:

All mtDNA References A III YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx

where A is the spreadsheet number (1-4), III are your initials, YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and DD is the day.

## Step 2. Collect PDFs
We’ll then collect PDFs of the papers we need and begin the real work.

## Step 3. Enter data
